# Machine Learning

Machine Learning exercises in MATLAB

##### Support Vector Machines

  - In this exercise, I used support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

##### Regularized Linear Regression

  - In this exercise, I implemented regularized linear regression and used it to
study models with different bias-variance properties.

##### Neural Networks

  - In this exercise, I implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition

##### Multi - Class Classification and Neural Networks

  - In this exercise, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

##### Logistic Regression

  - In this exercise, I implemented logistic regression and applied it to two different datasets.

##### K - Means Clustering and PCA

  - In this exercise, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. In the second part, you I used principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images. 

##### Anomaly Detection

  - In this exercise, I implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, I used collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies. 

### Tech

This exercise uses following technology:
